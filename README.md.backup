### Hi ðŸ‘‹  everyone, My name is Surendra Verma but I prefer calling Suri. 
- I have completed my PhD Degree in July 2022 from the Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. 
> NONLINEAR BENDING AND BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF LAMINATED AND SANDWICH CURVED PANELS IN HYGROTHERMAL ENVIRONMENT

- Please find my [CV](https://github.com/suri2501/CV/blob/main/main.pdf)
### Research details
My research research lies in finite element and isogeometric analysis, linear and nonlinear bending, buckling, free vibration, transient, steady state harmonic analysis of advanced composites (laminated, sandwich, FGM, CNT reinforced composite) plates and panels during both dry and hygrothermal enviornements. 
### Other education details
I have also done my Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) from the same place during 2010-2015. During my undergraduate stuides, I got interest in website developement, software development.  As a results of these interst, I got job opportunies in two software company as software developer during the institute placement session. However, I joined the PhD program in the same department in July 2016.
